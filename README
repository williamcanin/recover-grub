  B - After starting the terminal Arch Linux, you must make a connection
      with the internet to install Git and do clone "Grub Ransom".
      If the machine is connected via a network cable, probably
      the connection is already available. If connection by Wifi,
      use the command:

      # wifi-menu

      This command will enable a setting with the internet through
      of wifi. When setting up your connection, use the following
      command to ping and test the connection to the internet:

      # ping -c3 <any site>

      and install the package "git".
      To do this use the following command:

      # pacman -Sy && pacman -S git --noconfirm

      clone of "Grub Ransom"... running the commands below:

      # git config --global user.email "<Your Email>"
      # git config --global user.email "<Your Name>"
      # git clone https://github.com/williamcanin/grub-ransom.git
      # cd grub-ransom

  E - < Making "Grub Ransom" work: >
      At this moment, the terminal is inside the folder "Grub Ransom",
      and what you have to do is just run the command to start the
      recovery of Grub to "Grub Ransom".
      For this, you should know which device the Arch Linux is installed.
      For example: sda, sdb, sdc,... etc.
      After learning that the device, run the following command:

      # grub-ransom device <sda|sdb|sdc...>

  F - After the "Grub Ransom" start, you will enter the assembly section
      to mount the partition where the Arch Linux is installed and
      subsequently to the recovery section of Grub where will ask the
      user to enter the recovery command.
      Follow the steps, you can not go wrong!
